## Magizbox

My name is Vu Anh: I'm an engineering working at a startup in Hanoi, Vietnam. I love coding and writing. So I make this site to share some notes about computer science and data science, maybe some other things such as git, agile, docker,... It's helpful for me to keep my hobby and note my pieces of information what I usually forget, I hope it will be useful for you too.

PS: I always looking for collaboration. Feel free to contact me via twitter @rain_1024 or email brother.rain.1024[at]gmail.com (I will answer all emails for sure).

## Magizbox Stories 

Oct 2, 2016: Wow. It's 524th of my journey. I added some notes in README.md, index.html, changed structure of website. Today I feel like at begin day when I start writing at datayo.wordpress.com blog. In this pass, there are times when I want to make a professional website like tutorialpoints or something like that (but It doesn't work that way), because in my heart, I don't want it, I don't to make a professional website. I just love coding, writing and sharing my hobby with someone around the world. So today I come back to starting point, I will keep my writing schedule, make some fun stuff week by week.

In July 2016, I turn to use HTML and mkdocs, and opensource magizbox.

In March 2015, I start writing blog with wordpress.
